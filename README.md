# euro2016-calendar-ics-exporter
ical compliant export for the schedule of the EURO 2016 Tournament. You could think of it as a team-dynamic calendar download.

See in action at [its Website](http://kralo.github.io/euro2016-calendar-ics-exporter).

Two motivations drew this project

- (1) showcase the possibilities of dynamic ical generation and the use of subscription for calendars
- (2) leverare AWS CloudFront to handle the workload (and creatively pass the parameters as an html file-name).
